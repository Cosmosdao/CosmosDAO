# What Are the Goals of Cosmos DAO?

### Securing Protocol-Owned Liquidity:

\
Drawing inspiration from Olympus DAO’s bonding mechanism, Cosmos DAO locks liquidity into its protocol treasury to establish a stable asset foundation. This reduces reliance on market volatility and fosters a sustainable DeFi ecosystem.

### Community-Driven Governance:

\
Cosmos DAO empowers token holders to shape the protocol’s direction through voting, eliminating centralized decision-making and implementing a fully decentralized governance model.

### Expanding the DeFi Ecosystem:

\
Leveraging cross-chain interoperability, Cosmos DAO facilitates seamless interactions across diverse blockchains. It builds a trading platform for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) based on real-world assets (RWAs) and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the protocol develops a range of DeFi primitives, such as loan products, to expand its ecosystem. DAO community members can freely propose new products, utilize governance voting to deploy treasury funds, and maximize returns through innovative financial instruments.

### Maximizing Treasury Revenue:

\
Through governance-driven staking and bonding mechanisms, Cosmos DAO offers attractive Annual Percentage Yields (APY) while ensuring the protocol’s long-term sustainability. The community leverages governance voting to allocate treasury funds to RWA-based products, CDS platforms, loan products, and other initiatives, optimizing profitability and reinforcing financial resilience.
