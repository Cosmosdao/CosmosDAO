# COS and gCOS

### KOS

KOS is the native token of KOS DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, fully backed by the protocol’s treasury. Unlike traditional stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, KOS is designed as a free-floating flatcoin, utilizing the Range Bound Stability (RBS) system to maintain a programmatically defined price range transparently. KOS aims to bridge the gap between fiat-backed stablecoins and highly volatile cryptocurrency assets, offering relative price stability and scalability.Key Features

* Non-Pegged Design:\
  KOS is not pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar or won. Instead, it employs the RBS system to maintain a flexible price range, dynamically adjusting to market conditions. The minimum price is guaranteed by the assets held in the treasury, such as 1 DAI or equivalent stable assets.
* Treasury-Backed Stability:\
  KOS is fully supported by the KOS DAO treasury, which comprises stable assets like DAI, FRAX, ETH, and liquidity pool (LP) tokens, ensuring robust financial backing.
* Dynamic Supply Adjustment:\
  The supply of KOS is algorithmically adjusted based on market supply and demand:
  * Price Increase: Additional KOS tokens are minted to expand supply.
  * Price Decrease: Tokens are burned or removed from circulation to stabilize the price.
* Decentralized Governance:\
  KOS DAO operates through fully decentralized, community-driven governance. KOS holders can participate in protocol upgrades and policy decisions, ensuring a transparent and inclusive decision-making process.

### sKOS (Staked KOS)

**Overview**\
Staking KOS at a 1:1 ratio yields sKOS, which reflects staking rewards through periodic rebase adjustments that increase the token balance.

* Functionality:\
  sKOS serves as a mechanism for generating returns by leveraging the revenue from KOS DAO’s treasury assets.

### gKOS (Governance KOS)

**Overview**\
gKOS is an ERC-20 token dedicated to governance within KOS DAO, used for proposing and voting on protocol upgrades.

* Functionality:\
  sKOS can be wrapped to convert into gKOS, and gKOS can be unwrapped back into sKOS. gKOS holders participate in governance voting and can contribute to managing the treasury portfolio, generating additional returns.
