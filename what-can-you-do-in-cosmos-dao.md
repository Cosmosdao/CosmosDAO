# What Can You Do in Cosmos DAO?

### Bonding

\
Users can bond DAI to purchase Cosmos DAO’s stablecoin at a discounted rate, which can then be exchanged for governance tokens. Bonded assets are locked in the protocol’s treasury, enhancing liquidity and strengthening the ecosystem’s financial foundation.

### Staking

\
By staking governance tokens, participants share in the protocol’s revenue. Staking also grants voting rights, incentivizing active participation in governance processes.

### Governance Participation

\
Token holders can propose new DeFi products (such as RWA-based Credit Default Swaps or loan products), allocate treasury funds, support DeFi projects, and vote on measures to maintain token price stability, ensuring a community-driven decision-making process.

### DeFi Product Development and Investment

\
Community members are encouraged to propose innovative DeFi products, such as CDS trading platforms and loan products. Through governance voting, the treasury can be utilized to develop and invest in these initiatives, fostering financial innovation.

### Liquidity Provision and Rewards

\
Participants can provide assets to liquidity pools and earn token rewards or transaction fees. By leveraging cross-chain bridges, Cosmos DAO enables liquidity provision across multiple blockchains, enhancing interoperability.

### Community Engagement

\
The community drives ecosystem growth by creating DeFi products, onboarding developers, and collaborating with other DeFi projects. These activities foster a vibrant and dynamic community, strengthening the Cosmos DAO ecosystem.
