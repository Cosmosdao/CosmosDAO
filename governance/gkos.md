# gCOS

#### What is gCOS?

gCOS is an ERC-20 governance token dedicated to Cosmos DAO, created by wrapping COS tokens at a 1:1 ratio.&#x20;

For example, wrapping 100 COS yields 100&#x20;



#### gCOS.Role

gCOS holders can participate in policy proposals and voting within Cosmos DAO. Without gCOS, there are no voting rights.

#### Conversion

gCOS can be unwrapped back into COS at any time to revert to the original token.Staking Rewards:\
gCOS receives rebase rewards, similar to staked COS (sCOS), with its value increasing based on the Current Index.

#### **In Simple Terms**:

gCOS acts like a membership pass for voting in Cosmos DAO, obtained by temporarily locking COS. It allows participation in voting, and can be converted back to COS afterward if desired.
