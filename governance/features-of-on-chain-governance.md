# Features of On-Chain Governance

#### Features of On-Chain Governance

Cosmos DAO is committed to fully on-chain governance, delivering the following key benefits:

* **Transparency**: All voting records, proposal details, and execution outcomes are immutably stored on the blockchain, ensuring a fully auditable and community-driven process free from centralized interference. This allows every participant to verify actions in real-time.
* **Security**: Smart contract automation minimizes human error and enhances trust by enforcing predefined rules, while robust cryptographic protections safeguard against unauthorized alterations.
* **Immutability**: Once recorded, governance actions cannot be altered, providing a tamper-proof historical ledger that reinforces accountability.

**In Simple Terms**:\
All decisions are openly recorded on the blockchain, preventing any hidden manipulations and ensuring everyone can trust the process.



#### Connection Between Staking and Governance

xCOS holders are entitled to staking rewards, aligned with the same rebase mechanism

* **Rebase Mechanism**: Rebase events occur periodically (e.g., every 8 hours), with reward adjustments dynamically calculated based on COS supply, treasury revenue, and market conditions to maintain stability and incentivize participation.
* **Reward Distribution**: Rewards are automatically credited to xCOS holders’ wallets, reflecting their contribution to the ecosystem’s liquidity and governance.
* **Incentive Structure**: This reward system not only compensates participants but also encourages long-term commitment by linking staking benefits to active governance involvement, fostering a self-sustaining community.



**In Simple Terms**:\
Holding xCOS grants both voting rights and regular staking rewards, making active participation in governance more attractive and rewarding.
