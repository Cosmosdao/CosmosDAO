# Features of On-Chain Governance

1. **Features of On-Chain Governance**\
   Cosmos DAO aims for fully on-chain governance, offering the following benefits:

* **Transparency:** All voting and execution records are publicly stored on the blockchain, ensuring community-driven operations without centralized interference.
* **Security:** Automation through smart contracts enhances trust and reliability.

All decisions are transparently recorded on the blockchain, preventing hidden manipulations.



2. **Connection Between Staking and Governance**

* gKOS holders receive staking rewards, following the same rebase mechanism as sKOS (Staked KOS).
* Rebases occur periodically (e.g., every 8 hours), with rewards adjusted based on KOS supply and treasury conditions.
* This serves as an incentive to encourage governance participation.

Holding gKOS provides not only voting rights but also additional rewards, making participation more appealing.
