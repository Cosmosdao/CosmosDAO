# Governance Lifecycle

#### Governance Lifecycle of Cosmos DAO

* **Proposal Creation**:\
  Any individual can submit a proposal on the Cosmos DAO forum, such as Snapshot, to initiate community-driven changes. Proposals may encompass a wide range of topics, including:
  * Utilization of treasury assets (e.g., allocating funds for new initiatives).
  * Protocol upgrades (e.g., enhancing smart contract functionalities).
  * Parameter adjustments (e.g., modifying Range-Bound Stability (RBS) upper/lower limits, capacity caps, or sell tax mitigation strategies).\
    Following submission, proposals enter a community discussion phase where participants can provide feedback, suggest amendments, and build consensus over a period typically lasting 3–5 days before proceeding to a formal vote.\

* **Voting**:\
  xCOS holders are eligible to vote on proposals, with options to approve, reject, or abstain. The voting process is conducted on-chain, utilizing a blockchain such as Polygon, ensuring transparency with all votes immutably recorded. The voting period is structured to last between 3–7 days, allowing sufficient time for community deliberation. A quorum (e.g., a minimum percentage of xCOS holders participating) and a majority threshold (e.g., 51% of votes) are typically required for a proposal to pass, depending on governance parameters set by the DAO.\

* **Execution**:\
  Once a proposal gains approval, it is automatically executed through pre-programmed smart contracts. For instance, if a proposal to allocate 100,000 DAI to develop a new financial product is passed, the smart contract triggers the transfer of funds from the treasury to the designated project wallet. Execution is monitored on-chain, with timestamps and transaction details publicly verifiable, ensuring accountability and efficiency. Additionally, parameters such as rebase, RBS system settings, and other metrics can be adjusted.\

* **Profit Distribution**:\
  Should executed proposals, such as derivatives or structured financial products, generate profits, these earnings are distributed as sCOS to various stakeholders:
  * Governance participants (proportional to their xCOS holdings or voting activity).
  * Liquidity pools and providers who supported the initiative.
  * The broader Cosmos DAO community, fostering equitable reward sharing.\
    Distribution occurs periodically (e.g., monthly or after profit realization) and is automated via smart contracts, with transparency maintained through on-chain records.

#### In Simple Terms:

Cosmos DAO operates like an online shareholder meeting with a structured process. Anyone can propose ideas—such as using treasury funds or upgrading the protocol—on the forum like Snapshot. xCOS holders then vote on these ideas over a few days, and if approved, smart contracts automatically carry them out, including adjustments to rebase or RBS system parameters. Profits from successful projects are shared with voters, liquidity providers, and the community as sCOS rewards.
