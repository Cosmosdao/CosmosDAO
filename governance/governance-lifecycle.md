# Governance process

**Proposal Creation:**

* Anyone can submit a proposal on the Cosmos DAO forum (e.g., Snapshot).
* Proposals may include treasury asset usage, protocol upgrades, or parameter changes (e.g., adjusting RBS upper/lower limits, cap, or sell tax mitigation).
* Proposals undergo community discussion before moving to a vote.



**Voting:**

* gCOS holders vote on proposals, choosing to approve, reject, or abstain.
* Voting occurs on-chain (e.g., Polygon blockchain) and is transparently recorded.
* The voting period typically lasts 3–7 days.



**Execution:**

* Approved proposals are automatically executed via smart contracts.
* Example: If a proposal to allocate 100,000 DAI to a specific product is passed, the contract executes it.



**Profit Distribution:**

* If executed derivatives generate profits, those profits are distributed as sCOS to governance participants, the Pool, providers, and Cosmos DAO community members.



**In Simple Terms:**\
Cosmos DAO functions like an online shareholder meeting. gCOS holders propose new ideas, vote on decisions, and approved actions are automatically executed.
