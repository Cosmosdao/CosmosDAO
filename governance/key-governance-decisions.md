# Key Governance Decisions

**Treasury Management:**

* Deciding how to use assets held in the treasury (e.g., DAI, FRAX, ETH).
* Examples: Investing in DeFi projects, adding liquidity pools, issuing bonds, investing in Real-World Assets (RWA), or derivatives.\


**Range Bound Stability (RBS) Adjustments:**

* Modifying parameters to set the price range (upper/lower limits) for KOS.
* Example: Reducing the Wall Spread from 10% to 8%.\


**Protocol Upgrades:**

* Improving smart contracts or adding new features.
* Example: Adding cross-chain transfer functionality (using LayerZero).\


**Rebase Reward Adjustments:**

* Rebases periodically (e.g., every 8 hours) adjust rewards based on KOS supply and treasury conditions.
* Example: Reducing rebase rewards to stabilize prices during excessive inflation.\


**Community Rewards:**

* Adjusting staking reward rates or bond discount rates.\


**In Simple Terms:**\
Cosmos DAO decides how to allocate treasury funds, manage KOS price stability, and improve the system.
