# COS and gCOS

### COS

COS is the native token of COS DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, fully backed by the protocol’s treasury. Unlike traditional stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, COS is designed as a free-floating flatcoin, utilizing the Range Bound Stability (RBS) system to maintain a programmatically defined price range transparently. COS aims to bridge the gap between fiat-backed stablecoins and highly volatile cryptocurrency assets, offering relative price stability and scalability.Key Features

* Non-Pegged Design:\
  COS is not pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar or won. Instead, it employs the RBS system to maintain a flexible price range, dynamically adjusting to market conditions. The minimum price is guaranteed by the assets held in the treasury, such as 1 DAI or equivalent stable assets.
* Treasury-Backed Stability:\
  COS is fully supported by the COS DAO treasury, which comprises stable assets like DAI, FRAX, ETH, and liquidity pool (LP) tokens, ensuring robust financial backing.
* Dynamic Supply Adjustment:\
  The supply of COS is algorithmically adjusted based on market supply and demand:
  * Price Increase: Additional COS tokens are minted to expand supply.
  * Price Decrease: Tokens are burned or removed from circulation to stabilize the price.
* Decentralized Governance:\
  COS DAO operates through fully decentralized, community-driven governance. COS holders can participate in protocol upgrades and policy decisions, ensuring a transparent and inclusive decision-making process.

### sCOS (Staked COS)

**Overview**\
Staking COS at a 1:1 ratio yields sCOS, which reflects staking rewards through periodic rebase adjustments that increase the token balance.

* Functionality:\
  sCOS serves as a mechanism for generating returns by leveraging the revenue from COS DAO’s treasury assets.

### gCOS (Governance COS)

**Overview**\
gCOS is an ERC-20 token dedicated to governance within Cosmos DAO, used for proposing and voting on protocol upgrades.

* Functionality:\
  sCOS can be wrapped to convert into gCOS, and gCOS can be unwrapped back into sCOS. gCOS holders participate in governance voting and can contribute to managing the treasury portfolio, generating additional returns.
