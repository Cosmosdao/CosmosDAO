# Treasury

The Treasury is a key component of the Cosmos protocol.&#x20;

The Treasury represents all assets owned and controlled by the protocol.

The primary responsibility of the Treasury is to ensure $COS liquidity on open markets and stabilize $COS with direct market operations in certain situations.The Treasury is comprised of reserve assets and $COS liquidity positions, which are held in the on-chain treasury contract.&#x20;

Cosmos employs a streamlined treasury management strategy with reserve assets held as sDAI.&#x20;

**RBS** (Range Bound Stability) accesses the sDAI as needed for operations, automatically converting to DAI when called for. Additionally, through on-chain governance, **DAO** members can operate a portion of the Treasury's assets as Real World Assets (**RWA**), connecting them to **DeFi** to enable use cases such as on-chain mortgages, trade finance, and permissionless securitization of cash flows.&#x20;

In the future, access rights to additional modules can also be granted through on-chain governance.
