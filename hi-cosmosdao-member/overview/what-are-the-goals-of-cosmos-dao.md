# What Are the Goals of Cosmos DAO?

## Goals of Cosmos DAO

### 1. Community-Driven Governance

Cosmos DAO establishes community governance as the foundation of all strategic decision-making. By empowering token holders to shape the protocol's direction through voting, we eliminate centralized decision-making entirely and implement a truly decentralized governance model that serves as the cornerstone of all our initiatives.

### 2. Securing Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)

Through governance-driven asset management, Cosmos DAO employs bonding mechanisms to securely lock liquidity into our protocol treasury. This approach reduces dependence on market volatility and fosters a self-sustaining and resilient DeFi ecosystem built on community-controlled foundations.

### 3. DeFi Ecosystem Expansion & Innovation

We combine cross-chain interoperability with tokenization of traditional financial instruments to build a next-generation DeFi ecosystem

### 4. Hybrid Finance Model

*  Fusion of traditional finance (CDS, CDO) with DeFi-native mechanisms
* Development of Credit Default Swap (CDS) trading platforms based on both real-world assets (RWAs) and cryptocurrencies
* Creation of institutional and retail-accessible structures that bridge traditional and decentralized finance

### 5. Community-Driven Innovation

*  DAO community members can freely propose new financial products
* Strategic treasury fund deployment through governance voting
* Continuous development of diverse DeFi primitives including lending products

### 6. Maximizing Treasury Revenue

Through governance-centric integrated revenue generation strategies, we pursue sustainable high yields:

* Attractive Annual Percentage Yields (APY) through staking and bonding mechanisms
* Diversified investment portfolio including RWA-based products, CDS platforms, and lending products
* Balanced pursuit of profitability optimization and financial resilience enhancement
* Transparent and efficient asset management through community governance
