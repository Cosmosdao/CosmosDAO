# What Are the Goals of Cosmos DAO?

## Goals of Cosmos DAO

#### 1. Community-Driven Governance

Cosmos DAO establishes community governance as the foundation of all strategic decision-making. By empowering token holders to shape the protocol's direction through voting, we eliminate centralized decision-making entirely and implement a truly decentralized governance model that serves as the cornerstone of all our initiatives.

#### 2. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)

Through governance-driven asset management, Cosmos DAO employs bonding mechanisms to securely lock liquidity into our protocol treasury. This approach reduces dependence on market volatility and fosters a self-sustaining and resilient DeFi ecosystem built on community-controlled foundations.

#### **3.DeFi Ecosystem Expansion & Innovation**

We combine cross-chain interoperability with tokenization of traditional financial instruments to build a next-generation DeFi ecosystem:

*   **Hybrid Defi Model**

    * Fusion of Web2 and Web3 asset-based mechanisms in a hybrid DeFi framework
    * Development of decentralized trading platforms based on Web2 and Web3 assets
    * Creation of a hybrid DeFi structure accessible to both institutional


* **Community-Driven Innovation**  \
  DAO community members can freely propose new financial products\
  Strategic treasury fund deployment through governance voting\
  Continuous development of diverse DeFi primitives including lending products

#### **4.Maximizing Treasury Revenue**

Through governance-centric integrated revenue generation strategies, we pursue sustainable high yields:

* Attractive Annual Percentage Yields (APY) through staking and bonding mechanisms
* Diversified investment portfolio including RWA-based products, CDS platforms, and lending products
* Balanced pursuit of profitability optimization and financial resilience enhancement
* Transparent and efficient asset management through community governance
