# What Can You Do in Cosmos DAO?

Cosmos DAO offers a comprehensive range of activities that empower participants to actively engage in its DeFi 3.0 ecosystem:

* **Bonding**\
  Users can bond DAI to purchase $COS tokens at discounted rates, which can then be exchanged for governance tokens. Bonded assets are locked in the protocol's treasury, strengthening liquidity and reinforcing the ecosystem's financial foundation.\
  Additionally, participants can acquire $COS tokens through discounted bonds by transferring liquidity provider (LP) tokens to the protocol, contributing to DAO Managed Liquidity(DML) development.

* **Staking**\
  By staking tokens, participants can earn interest from the protocol. Staking also grants voting rights, incentivizing active participation in governance processes and protocol evolution.\

*   **Governance Participation**\
    Token holders can shape core protocol policies through:

    * Treasury fund allocation and investment direction decisions
    * New partnership approvals and ecosystem expansion initiatives
    * Token price stability measures and monetary policy adjustments
    * Protocol upgrades and technical improvement implementations\
      This ensures community-driven transparent decision-making across all strategic initiatives.


* **Structured Finance Development & Infinity Scaling**\
  **Cosmos DAO's Core Innovation:**\
  Community members can propose and develop innovative structured financial products targeting every market in the world:

      * **Derivatives**: Swaps, options, futures, structured products with unlimited creative possibilities
      * **DAO Review & Approval**: Governance voting determines development funding allocation
      * **Development Funding**: Treasury provides product development costs, underlying asset pooling, and technical infrastructure funding


*   **Infinity Scaling Revenue Model**\
    **Core Mechanism:**

    * Development loan → Product launch → Principal recovery → Continuous interest revenue
    * **Sustainable Revenue Cycle:**
      * $1M Development Loan → Financial Product Launch → $1M Principal Recovery via Sales → DAO earns 8-15% continuous interest → Investors receive bonds and residual profits → Development funds recycled for new products → Infinite iteration
    * **Token Demand Growth Effect**:
      * As treasury lending becomes active, individuals and institutions requiring loans will purchase and hold $COS tokens for governance voting participation. This creates sustained $COS token demand and long-term value appreciation.


*   **Self-Reinforcing Ecosystem**

    * Product Success → More Developer Influx → Higher $COS Demand
    * Token Value Growth → Larger Treasury → Greater Lending Capacity
    * More Financial Products → Higher Interest Revenue → Stronger Token Support


* **Cross-Chain Liquidity and Rewards**\
  Multi-blockchain liquidity provision via cross-chain bridges enables earning interoperability rewards while contributing to Cosmos DAO ecosystem's multi-chain expansion.



* **Community Ecosystem Building**\
  The community drives sustainable financial ecosystem growth through:
  * **Developer Onboarding**: Attracting new DeFi builders into the Cosmos DAO ecosystem
  * **Strategic Partnerships**: Building collaborations with DeFi projects, RWA providers, and traditional financial institutions
  * **Education & Research**: Expanding community knowledge in DeFi 3.0 innovation and structured finance
