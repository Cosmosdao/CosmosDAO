# Introduction

### Cosmos DAO Treasury Model: A Refined Overview

The Cosmos DAO Treasury is a cornerstone of the Cosmos protocol, serving as a decentralized financial hub that manages and optimizes protocol-owned assets, including $COS tokens, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies. Designed to ensure stability, transparency, and growth, the Treasury empowers $COS token holders to make democratic decisions on fund allocation, investments, and stability measures through an on-chain voting mechanism. The Cosmos Treasury model focuses on maintaining the value of the $COS token, supporting ecosystem development, and generating sustainable revenue within the DeFi 3.0 ecosystem.



**Core Functions and Responsibilities**

The Treasury holds and manages all protocol-owned assets, prioritizing the provision of $COS liquidity in open markets and stabilizing its value through direct market operations in specific scenarios. Additionally, through DAO governance, it enables the operation of assets within a hybrid DeFi system, referred to as Hybrid DeFi, to generate revenue, which can be distributed among DAOs. The Treasury comprises:

* **Reserve Assets**: Provide a stable foundation for treasury operations.
* **Liquidity Positions**: $COS liquidity pools and other assets to support market stability and protocol functionality.
* **DAO Governance Operations**: Through on-chain governance, DAO members can operate assets in a Hybrid DeFi system, generating revenue and enabling profit distribution among DAOs.

The Treasury adopts a streamlined management strategy, utilizing the **Range Bound Stability (RBS)** mechanism to enhance operational efficiency. Access to additional modules in the future can also be granted via on-chain governance.



**Key Features**

* **Asset Pooling**: Aggregates staked $COS, liquidity provider (LP) tokens, and stablecoins to build a diverse and resilient asset base.
* **Price Stability**: Utilizes automated supply adjustments (rebasing) to maintain $COS at a stable value of 1 USD.
* **Revenue Generation**: Leverages staking, lending, strategic partnerships, and Hybrid DeFi system operations to generate sustainable revenue and support profit distribution among DAOs.
* **Transparency**: Ensures all transactions and governance decisions are immutably recorded on the blockchain, fostering trust and accountability.



**Strategic Vision**

The Cosmos DAO Treasury balances stability and innovation, enabling community-driven governance while leveraging Hybrid DeFi systems to generate and distribute revenue among DAOs. By integrating DeFi protocols and Hybrid DeFi operations, the Treasury not only safeguards the protocolâ€™s financial health but also unlocks new opportunities in decentralized finance, positioning Cosmos as a leader in the DeFi 3.0 landscape.
